## Project Details 
This application was created to help businesses keep track of client information conveniently and efficiently. 
This application does this through keeping track of the businesses customers, sales orders, and receipts.

### Customers

This application allows the user to create customer profiles which include: name, address, phone number and email. The user can easily input this information for however many customer profiles they wish to create and then view these customer profiles in a seperate page.

### Sales Orders

This application allows the user to create sales orders which include: the customers id, description and amount. The user can easliy input this information for however many sales orders they wish to create. These sales orders can then be viewed in a seperate page where the option will be given for the user to mark the order as paid. In order to mark the sales order as paid, the user must click the "Pay" button to the left of the sales order that they would like to mark as paid. If the user chooses to mark the sales order as paid, this order will be removed from the sales order page and will be added to the receipts page. 

### Receipts 

Contrary to customers and sales orders, receipts may only be created through marking a sales order as paid in the View Sales Order page. All receipts can be viewed in the receipts page.
